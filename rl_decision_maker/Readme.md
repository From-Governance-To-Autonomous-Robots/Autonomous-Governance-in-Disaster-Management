# Causal Reinforcement Learning Decision Maker

## TO:DO 

- [ ] Build the Gym Environment for the Decision Maker
- [ ] Run inference on the records , create the train and validation records for training . 
- [ ] See how Causal Discovery could be used for the Gather Additional Data to form a prediction on what decision to take - maybe using the confidence scores to update the logic table. 
- [ ] Design a Cost Function to maximize the score , the score will be in relation to how many people were saved, and the failures will be counted as the number of failed trees.
- [ ] Integrate Logging with Wandb
- [ ] Train and Create a Report for the RL agent
